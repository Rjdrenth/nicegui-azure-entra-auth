This repository shows an example how you could build a NiceGUI web application and use Azure Entra to authenticate your microsoft users.

When I tried deploying my NiceGUI webapp as an Azure Web App I found that adding Entra authentication as an identity provider as a plug-and-play
solution to an Azure Web App did not work, as it blocked NiceGUI's websocket communication. This meant I had to resort to adding the authentication
flow to the application myself. No doubt this method, the method I came up with, is not the best method. I am open to suggestions and improving it.  

This is not a full-fledged repository with proper documentation, it is a bare-minimum effort to hopefully help someone else achieve the same.
Nevertheless, provided you jumped through all the regular hoops to register an application in Entra and provided the necessary values in the
[/.env](/.env.template) file, the example application is functional.

The example application itself can be found at [/nicegui_azure_entra_auth/minimal_nicegui_entra_auth_example.py](nicegui_azure_entra_auth/minimal_nicegui_entra_auth_example.py).
